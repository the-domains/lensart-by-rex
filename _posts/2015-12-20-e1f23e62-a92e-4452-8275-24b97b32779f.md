Happy Holidays!

May everyone have a great Christmas and a good beginning to the upcoming new year.

This new site is for my personal projects and artwork.

It would be appreciated if you would view my work and share with your friends and family.

I value constructive input and views, as I am always curious and like to understand others perspectives on many things.

The difference between you and me is our life experiences; the experiences that made us, drove us, directed us, guided us to who we are today.

I am interested in what excites you about visual art; photography, paintings, sculptures, architecture, travelling to new sights, etc.
